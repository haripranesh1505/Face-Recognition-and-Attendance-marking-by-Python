# Face-Recognition-and-Attendance-marking-by-Python
Attendance of students in a large classroom is hard to be handled by the traditional  system,  as  it  is  time-consuming  and  has  a  high  probability  of  error during  the  process  of  inputting  data  into  the  computer.  This  paper  proposed automated  attendance  marking  system  using  face  recognition  technique.  The system deployed Haar cascade to find the positive and negative of the face and eigen face  algorithm  for  face  recognition  by  using  python  programming  and Open CV library. The attendance of the student was updated to the Excel sheet after studentâ€™s face has been recognized.
